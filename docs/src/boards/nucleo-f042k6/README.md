nucleo-f042k6
=============

_nucleo-f042k6_ contains a basic board support package for the fabulous [STM
Nucleo-F042K6][] microcontroller board to write firmwares using Rust. This
standard format board provides 1 user programmable LED as well as "Arduino
Nano" headers which can be used to connect peripherals. It also contains a
(non-removable, unlike the bigger Nucleo boards) capable ST-Link V2 debugging
interface, so all that one needs to get going with progamming this device is:

* A STM Nucleo-F042K6 board
* A computer (macOS and Linux work perfectly, Windows should work but was not tested)
* A bit of open source software
