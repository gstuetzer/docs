# Developements documentation

Generiert mit der Hilfe **mdBook**
is a command line tool and Rust crate to create books using Markdown
files. It's very similar to Gitbook but written in
[Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org).

What you are reading serves as an example of the output of mdBook and at the
same time as a high-level documentation.

> **💡 Tip:** You can search through this book by clicking on the 🔍 icon at the
> top of the page, or by pressing the `s` key.

mdBook is free and open source, you can find the source code on
[GitHub](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook). Issues and feature
requests can be posted on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook/issues).
