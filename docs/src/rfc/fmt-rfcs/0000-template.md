# Summary
[summary]: #summary

One para explanation of the guideline.


# Details
[details]: #details

This should get into specifics and corner-cases, and include examples of code
which satisfies and violates the guideline, and it interacts with other
formatting guidelines.

Guidelines may include more than one acceptable rule, but should offer guidance
for when to use each rule (guidance which should be formal enough to be used by
Rustfmt).


# Implementation
[implementation]: #implementation

This should specify how Rustfmt options must be set to enforce the guideline,
and what further changes (including additional options) are required. It should
specify any renaming, reorganisation, or removal of options.


# Rationale
[rationale]: #rationale

This should motivate the choices behind the guideline. It should reference
existing code bases which use the proposed style.

# Alternatives
[alternatives]: #alternatives

What other designs have been considered?


# Unresolved questions
[unresolved]: #unresolved-questions

What parts of the design are still TBD?
